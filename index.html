                        <p>Hostel life is considered the best part of a student’s life. Those who have experienced it swear by it and those who haven’t wish they could. 
                            Hostel life comes with its set of advantages and disadvantages. Hostel life is full of friends, fun and independence. It gives numerous 
                            memories to the students to cherish forever. A student who has experienced hostel life is better off at taking decisions and forming viewpoint
                             about various things.</p>

                        <h3>Comfortable Living</h3>
                        <p>Staying in hostels is like living with a bunch of like-minded friends! Think of it like living in a frat house…unless 
                            that sounds like hell…in that case, scratch that. Hostels are great because they’re inexpensive, usually available on
                             the fly, provide you with a group of new connections and they immerse you in the country you’re visiting. Sure, some 
                             hostels are nicer than others, but at the end of the day it’s about having an epic travel experience.</p>
